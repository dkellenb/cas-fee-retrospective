#Usability-Test Findings
We did a _Usability-Test_ with the EDS Team from [Zentralen Informatikdiensten ZID Basel](http://www.zid.bs.ch/).

##SetUp
The Setup was a Team of 5 Peoples 

* 1 Team Leader who was leading the Retrospective
..* Had to create a new Retrospective
..* Let the team members join the retrospective
..* check if everybody is in the retrospective
..* Lead through the 4 Steps
* 4 Team Member joining the Retrospective with their mobile devices.
..* Join the retrospective (also add a short name for them self)
..* Add multiple comments to the 3 boards
..* Vote for their favour comments


##Findings
**Problems found**
1. It is not clear for all users that there are 2 forms in the initial page. Many users try to fill in both forms (join and create retrospective)
2. User had a while to understand to add a second sticky-note they had to click the button in the board header. (+) many thought this is a button to collapse the board.
3. On mobile devices the hover effect of the icon buttons stays. The users could not see if they had voted or not. (green background)
4. Many users try to click the covered sticky-notes. It was not clear for them that they will be revealed later in the process.

**What user don't liked**
1. Why does a sticky-note has to be with title and description?
2. Laggy experience on older devices. (Asus PadFone) 
3. User on the Laptop tried to start writing when a new sticky-note was added but they had to first set the fokus.

**What user liked**
1. Easy to log in. No need for creation of a account.
2. Not many buttons to click. So they were able to find the way just by try the few buttons.
3. See that other people write sticky-notes.
4. They had like a game experience and fun with their mobiles to enter sticky-notes and get votes in the end. 

##Potential Solutions
Because of the short time we had we were not able to change stuff around after the test-run. But we have some potential solutions we would try if we had more time.

1. Make the forms on the initial-page stand more apart from each other. Maybe change even the desinge so the board and background has more contrast.
2. Change the add button icon from a plus to something more logic for the user. (same icon as on the controllpanel step comment)
3. Make the hover-effect disappear on mobiles after a small amount of seconds.
4. Set fokus on the first input of a new sticky-note
5. Move the add button from the board-header bar in the board it self.
